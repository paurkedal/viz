===============================
 The Fform Source Distribution
===============================


About
=====

Fform is a statically typed, strict, and pure functional programming language
related to the ML family, and to some extent to Haskell.  Both the design and
the implementation is under development.  At the moment, a subset of the
language is implemented as an O'Caml preprocessor.  This will later be used to
bootstrap a full stand-alone implementation.


Directories
===========

* bin - Program source code and wrapper scripts.
* ffoc1 - The bootstrap O'Caml preprocessor.
* fflib - The Fform Standard Library.
* tests - OUnit tests.
