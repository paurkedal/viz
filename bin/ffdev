# are three ways to use it:
#
#   * Add the "bin" subdirectory to your $PATH.
#
#   * Create symbolic links corresponding to those in the "bin" subdirectory
#     under some directory which is included in your $PATH.
#
#   * Create a single symbolic link named "ffdev" to this wrapper under some
#     directory which is included in your $PATH.

'realpath' or a GNU 'readlink', or by setting \$FFORM_SRCDIR to the top-level
directory of your Fform check-out.
